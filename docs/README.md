IoC Service Container with proposal decorator, proxy resolver and destructuring injection provides a very simple, centralized container that stores and resolves libraries, objects, and values to better organize code, manage dependencies, and enhance testability.

Benefits:

- Proposal decorator, allow you to decorate any class as a Service that must auto bind to the service container
- Proxy resolver, Allow you to resolve any class denpendencies as own property of the container instance
- Destructuring injection or Destructuring resolver, allow you to use dependencies in your class constructor using destructured parameter
- Autobinding, allow to bind any class with zero configuration
- Defers dependency resolution to mitigate circular references
